            This is an example of overflow property in CSS. Overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box. The overflow property can take one of the following values: visible, hidden, scroll, auto. In this example, we have set the overflow property to scroll, which means that if the content overflows the element's box, a scrollbar will be added to allow the user to scroll through the content. The height of the div is set to 75px, so if the content exceeds this height, a scrollbar will appear.
